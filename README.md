## About TFSCO
The Thin-film solar cell ontology (TFSCO) is a domain ontology that provides a model  of the manufacturing and characterization of perovskite solar cells. The TFSCO has been under development since 2022. The OWL-File was created using [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/). Protégé may be used for viewing and editing the ontology. The TFSCO classes can be viewed via the MatPortal.org Repository(Link below).

## Use of TFSCO
Efforts have been made to implement a Nomad<sup>1</sup> database/structure that enables a linkage between the ontology classes and the research data stored via the IRI. This secures a sustainable and machine readable data structure based on the of the ontology and a user friendly interface with quality of life features like filters, plots and histograms from Nomad.

## Upper-level Ontologies
The TFSCO uses the Basic Formal Ontology ([BFO](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO)) as its Top-Level Ontology. A selection of relations have been imported from the [RO](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/ro.html) (Relation Ontology).

## Mid- and Domain-level Ontologies
The TFSCO imports axioms from the following ontologies: [CHMO](https://github.com/rsc-ontologies/rsc-cmo) (Chemical Methods Ontology), [PATO](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/pato.html) (Phenotype and trait ontology), [CHEBI ](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/chebi) (Chemical entities of biological interest), [IAO](https://github.com/information-artifact-ontology/IAO) (Information Artifact ontology).
